- Enhanced user feedback during operations

### 📦 Files

- `KeycapStudio-v1.3.0.zip` - Complete web application with performance optimizations
- `dist/` - Production build ready for deployment

### 🚀 Deployment

The application is a static single-page application. Simply serve the `dist/` folder with any static web server.

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8080 -d dist

# Using Node.js
npx serve dist
```

### 🔄 Migration Notes
